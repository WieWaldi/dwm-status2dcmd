# dwm 6.5

Temporary repository to fiddle arround. I doubt that the following patches
are compatible and working straight out of the box.

! dwm gets installed into '~/.local/bin'.

## Patches
The following patches have been applied.
  - dwm-status2d-6.3.diff
  - dwm-statuscmd-nosignal-status2d-20210402-60bb3df.diff

## Scripts
  - dwm-status to set status using "xsetroor -name"
  - dwm-satuscmd which gets called by clicking the status bar
